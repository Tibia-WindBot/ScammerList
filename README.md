# Black List

A list of people who tried to thief users on WindBot and got caught.
Current version: 1.2.23

## Summary
  Black List is a builder for the [main scammer thread] (http://forums.tibiawindbot.com/showthread.php?1901). It was created to easily manage and create that list on forums only by simply adding information about the scammer on the files here.
  
## Usage
  To use it just run "src/builder.lua" on Lua console, and if you want to use the list for your own, I'd appreciate if you could add as many information as you can on the list, considering of course the scams happening on Tibia botting scene.
  After you ran the file, go back to the main folder and check the file "output.txt", there you'll find all the information ready to copy-paste on forums.
  If you want to manage the users, check the file "src/blacklist.txt".
